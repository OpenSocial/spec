  <section title="Overview">
   <t>Gadgets are web-based software components based on HTML, CSS, and
   JavaScript. They allow developers to easily write useful web applications
   that work anywhere on the web without modification. They are defined using a
   declarative XML syntax that is processed by a gadget server into a format
   that allows them to be embedded into various contexts: standalone web pages,
   web applications, even other gadgets. A context into which a gadget is
   embedded is called a gadget container. The container is responsible for
   managing the gadgets' layout and controls, as well as for supporting various
   functionality on behalf of the gadget. A gadget may be a simple widget, a
   reusable component, or a full-blown application, possibly utilizing or
   communicating with other gadgets.</t>
   <t>This document describes the gadget XML syntax and how it is processed by
   a compliant gadget server. In addition, the document describes the core 
   JavaScript APIs that must be made available to every gadget as it is 
   rendered. In addition to the core JavaScript APIs, gadget servers SHOULD
   support the recommended features listed at the end of this document.</t>
  </section>
  <section title="Compliance">
   <t>To be a compliant Core Gadget Container, a server MUST be able to satisfy
   the requests defined in this section.</t>
   <section title="Retrieve Content Request" anchor="Retrieval">
    <t>Gadget Containers MUST be able to fetch remote files, such as
    gadget specs, message bundles, CSS files, or images.</t>
     <t>Files SHOULD be retrieved from the source URL that the Developer
     has provided to the Container. Containers MAY fetch equivalent documents
     from alternate sources (such as caches or rewriting services) as long as
     those services are responsible for retrieving the document themselves.</t>
     <t>Containers SHOULD cache the file after fetching it. If the Container caches
     a document, it MUST implement the caching policy as defined by RFC2616.
     Additionally, containers that cache documents SHOULD provide a mechanism to
     bypass the caching policy entirely to facilitate development, such as a
     "nocache" query string parameter passed to the page that the gadget is
     rendered on.  Containers MAY use expired cache entries for files to
     ensure that temporary network problems do not affect end users.</t>
   </section>
   <section title="Parse XML Request" anchor="Parsing">
    <t>XML documents MUST be well-formed, and Containers MUST display an error
    to Users if they are asked to process a malformed document. Containers
    SHOULD provide meaningful error messages to Developers when the
    specification is malformed.</t>
    <t>Containers MUST check for a @specificationVersion attribute in the root
    Module element of all XML documents they parse, and if the attribute is
    present in a document MUST parse and process the document in accordance with
    a version of this specification that matches the attribute's value, as
    described in <xref target="Versioning">Versioning</xref>. Containers SHOULD
    support as many historical specification versions as is practical, for
    backward compatibility with existing Gadgets. If a Container is unable to
    support a specification version that matches the value of a Gadget's
    @specificationVersion attribute, the Container MUST display an error
    message to Users, and SHOULD provide the specification versions that it
    does support to Developers.</t>
    <t>The XML MUST conform to the 
    <xref target="GadgetXmlSchema">Gadget XML Schema</xref> or the <xref target="MessageBundleSchema">Message Bundle Schema</xref>. These XSD schemas 
    represent all standard elements and attributes and
    allow for containers to support additional elements and attributes.
    </t>
    <t>Containers MAY support non-standard tags and attributes, but they MUST
    be enclosed in a separate XML namespace. This namespace SHOULD reflect the
    name of the organization responsible for the Container to avoid conflicts
    with other Containers. Containers are encouraged to try to find a way to
    work within the base schema whenever possible. Whenever an equivalent
    syntax is introduced into the standard, the Container MUST deprecate the
    proprietary extension and encourage their users to migrate to the
    standardized solution.</t>
    <t>Containers MUST ignore any attributes or tags that they can not
    interpret. This requirement is included to facilitate extensions to the
    schema for Container-specific uses. Containers MAY reject XML documents
    that do not provide all tags and attribute values required by the
    Container, but if they do so they MUST provide feedback to the Developer
    explaining the requirement.</t>
    <t>Containers MUST perform variable substitution according to the rules
    defined in 
    <xref target="VariableSubstitution">Variable Substitution</xref>.</t>
    <t>Containers MUST interpret any relative URLs found in XML attributes or
    values as relative to the gadget spec's URL. Containers MAY refuse to use
    or display the content referenced by these URLs at their discretion.</t>
   </section>
   <section title="Gadget Rendering Request" anchor="Rendering">
    <t>A Gadget Container's main function is to translate a Gadget XML file into content to deliver to the end user. A Gadget Rendering Request uses the following inputs:
      <list style="symbols">

       <t>Any User Preferences stored for a User, used in <xref target="VariableSubstitution">Variable Substitution</xref>.</t>
       <t>The View to render, for identifying the correct &lt;Content&gt; element(s) to display.</t>
       <t>The Locale of the User, for <xref target="Localization">Localization</xref>.</t>

     </t>
     <t>For type="url" gadgets, these inputs are used to generate a URL of content to display to the user as described in <xref target="Type">/Content/@type</xref>.</t>
     <t>For type="html" gadgets, these inputs are used to generate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as follows:

   <t>A Feature is a set of processing instructions and JavaScript libraries
   that provides some specific functionality for a Gadget.</t>
   <t>Containers MUST honor the feature-specific rules for any Feature that
   they claim to support. Any Feature not specified in this document SHOULD
   provide an external specification for processing so that implementations
   will be correct.</t>
   <t>Containers MUST provide an implementation of each Feature that matches
   the version specified by the Gadget in the /ModulePrefs/Required/@version or
   /ModulePrefs/Optional/@version attribute, applying the matching process
   described in <xref target="Versioning">Versioning</xref>. Containers MUST NOT
   substitute versions of Features that do not match the versions requested by
   the Gadget. Containers SHOULD support as many versions of each Feature as is
   practical, for backward compatibility with existing Gadgets. Containers MAY
   use the same implementation to satisfy several different versions of a
   Feature, if by doing so they fully comply with the Feature's
   specification.</t>
   <t>Containers MAY refuse to support Features or specific versions of Features
   that are known or assumed to be incompatible with the specification version
   required by the Gadget, or that are known to be incompatible with other
   Features or versions of Features required by the Gadget. For example, a
   Container MAY not support the combination of @specificationVersion="1.0"
   and &lt;Require feature="opensocial" version="2.0"&gt;, or the combination
   of &lt;Require feature="opensocial" version="1.0"&gt; and
   &lt;Require feature="opensocial-data" version="1.1"&gt;. In cases where such
   combinations are requested, the Features are said to be conflicting.
   Conflicting Features SHOULD be treated by Containers as if they were
   unsupported. Containers SHOULD provide an error message describing conflicts
   to Developers when a conflict is detected.  If one or more of the conflicting
   Features is specified as Optional by a Gadget, and the set of Required
   features and specification version do not conflict, Containers SHOULD attempt
   to render the Gadget by removing the conflicting optional Features, returning
   false from
   <xref target="gadgets.util.hasFeature">gadgets.util.hasFeature</xref>
   for the features that have been removed.  Containers SHOULD include the
   largest set of Optional Features that does not produce conflicts.</t>
   <t>Containers MUST display an error message for any feature that is
   requested by the Gadget as "required" but is not supported by the container.</t>
   <t>Containers MUST only return true for 
   <xref target="gadgets.util.hasFeature">gadgets.util.hasFeature</xref> if they
   actually support the given feature name at the version specified in the
   Gadget XML. Containers MAY only return true for this function if the feature

  <section title="Versioning"
           anchor="Versioning">
   <t>Both the overall OpenSocial specification and individual Gadget Features
   are versioned. Gadgets SHOULD specify the version of the specification that
   Containers should use to interpret them by including the @specificationVersion
   attribute on the root Module element, and the versions of any Features
   they use by including the @version attribute on
   /ModulePrefs/Require and /ModulePrefs/Optional elements.</t>
   <t>The version of this specification is "1.0.0". The versions of standard
   Features defined by this specification are detailed in
   <xref target="RequireAndOptional">ModulePrefs</xref>. Extensions to the OpenSocial
   specification MUST define the version of any Features specified by the
   extension. Containers SHOULD document the version of any custom Features
   they provide.</t>
   <t>Versions are specified as a string of up to three non-negative integers,
   separated by the dot (.) character, for example "1.0.0", "1.2.1", or
   "1.3.12". The three components of a version each signify a guarantee about
   the compatibility of that version with other versions of the same
   specification or Feature.</t>
   <list style="hanging">
    <t hangText="Major Versions">are represented by the first number in the
    sequence, for example "1" in "1.0.0", "1.0.2", "1.3.0", etc. Changes in the
    major version signify backward-incompatible changes from previous versions
    of the specification or Feature. For example, when Feature APIs or Gadget
    XML elements and attributes are removed or renamed, or significant changes
    to the Gadget rendering process are made that would result in malfunctions
    for existing Gadgets, the major version MUST be incremented.</t>
    <t hangText="Minor Versions">are represented by the second number in the
    sequence, for example "2" in "1.2.0", "1.2.1", "3.2.0", etc. Minor versions
    are interpreted relative to the preceding major version number. Changes in
    the minor version signify backward-compatible but forward-incompatible
    changes from previous versions of the specification or Feature. For example,
    when new Feature APIs or Gadget XML elements and attributes are added, the
    minor version MUST be incremented, but the major version SHOULD NOT change,
    because the new version is backward-compatible with Gadgets that were
    written to use previous minor versions of the same major version, but
    containers that do not implement the new minor version will not be
    forward-compatible with Gadgets written to use the new minor version.</t>
    <t hangText="Patch Versions">are represented by the third number in the
    sequence, for example "3" in "1.0.3", "1.1.3", "2.2.3", etc. Patch versions
    are interpreted relative to the preceding major and minor version numbers.
    Changes in the patch version signify changes that are both
    backward-compatible and forward-compatible with previous versions of the
    specification or Feature. For example, when making minor clarifications,
    fixing typos and bugs, or making other small changes that neither affect the
    functionality of existing Gadgets, nor introduce functionality that would be
    incompatible with containers that only implement older patch versions of the
    same minor version, the patch version MUST be incremented, but the minor
    and major versions SHOULD NOT change.</t>
   </list>
   <t>The value of the /@specificationVersion, /ModulePrefs/Require/@version,
   and /ModulePrefs/Optional/@version attributes may fully specify all three of
   the major version, minor version, and patch version numbers. For example,
   "1.0.0" or "1.2.3". When all three version components are specified,
   containers MUST conform to the exact version of the specification or
   Feature that is requested. Alternately, these attributes may specify the
   major and minor versions only, without the patch version, or the major
   version only, without the minor and patch versions. For example, "1.0",
   "2.3", and "3" are all valid. When these attributes specify partial versions,
   the container MUST conform to a version of the specification or Feature that
   matches the version components specified, but MAY use any version of the
   unspecified components.</t>
   <t>For example, a Container that is processing a Gadget with
   /@specificationVersion="2.3" may process it according to specification
   version 2.3.0, 2.3.1, 2.3.22, etc., but not 2.2.0, 2.4.0, 2.30.0, 3.0.0, etc.
   A Container that is processing a Gadget with
   /ModulePrefs/Require/@version="3" MAY provide the specified Feature at
   version 3.0.0, 3.0.1, 3.1.0, 3.1.11, etc., but not 2.0.0, 4.0.0, 33.0.0,
   etc.</t>
   <t>It is RECOMMENDED that Gadget Developers specify the most general version
   that will satisfy the requirements of a Gadget. Usually, major and minor
   versions will suffice, and the patch version MAY be omitted from
   /@specificationVersion, /ModulePrefs/Require/@version, and
   /ModulePrefs/Optional/@version attributes.</t>
   <t>If the /@specificationVersion attribute or any
   /ModulePrefs/Require/@version or /ModulePrefs/Optional/@version attributes
   are absent, they are assumed to have the value "1.0". As described above,
   this value will match any version beginning with "1.0", including 1.0.0,
   1.0.1, 1.0.22, etc., but not 1.1.0, 2.0.0, etc. This default value will
   not change in future versions of the specification, ensuring that Gadgets
   that omit these values will not have sudden, unexpected changes in behavior
   when containers adopt new versions of the OpenSocial specification or
   Features.</t>

   deploys new certificates. If the container deploys certificates at a
   well-known location, the recipient may automatically download the new
   certificate. Recipients that automatically download new certificates should
   cache the resulting certificates.</t>
   <t>If a container's certificate is not downloaded from

  <section title="OAuth"

   <t>Containers MUST support OAuth requests for

   Containers MAY use an OAuth Consumer key and secret specific to the gadget

  <section title="JavaScript API Reference" anchor="JavaScript-API-Reference">
    <t>OpenSocial's JavaScript API uses the following patterns:</t>
    <list style="hanging">
    <t hangText="Virtual Typing">
     <t>JavaScript is not strongly typed, but in order to make the developer
     experience consistent, the APIs are defined as if JavaScript supported
     strongly typed data. Cases where a parameter or return value are defined
     as a certain type in the documentation indicate that this is the only type
     that can be provided or accepted for OpenSocial compatibility. Any
     exceptions to this rule will be directly documented in the reference.</t>
     <t>As an example, the getErrorCode method is defined in the JavaScript API
     reference as returning a value of the type opensocial.ResponseItem.Error,
     although in practice this value will be a normal JavaScript string.
     However, developers can be assured that in a compliant container, the
     string returned is one of the opensocial.ResponseItem.Error fields.</t>
     <t>Enumerations figure heavily into the OpenSocial API. Developers are
     permitted to reference an enum or use the enum's value directly. To avoid
     collisions related to extensibility, containers must ensure that the names
     and values for an enum match the ones defined in the spec and that custom
     values are namespaced appropriately. For example, an Orkut custom field
     named MY_PERSON_FIELD could have a name of
     Orkut.PersonField.MY_PERSON_FIELD and a value of "Orkut.myPersonField".</t>
    </t>
    <t hangText="Parameter Maps">
     <t>Many of the OpenSocial methods have a large number of optional
     parameters. JavaScript's lack of strong typing makes overloading difficult
     at best, and having functions with a large amount of parameters can be
     difficult to manage (especially for developers not using a nice IDE).
     OpenSocial uses the "object bag" approach to optional parameters: many
     methods take an additional opt_params parameter that takes the form of a
     map of parameter names to their corresponding values.</t>
     <t>For each method which uses an opt_params map the spec defines all of
     the valid fields that will be read out of the map by the container. These
     fields have defined types as discussed in the Virtual typing section. If a
     developer adds an invalid value for a field in the map the container
     SHOULD return the BAD_REQUEST error code.</t>

        <t hangText="opensocial_instance_id">Optional. An opaque identifier
        used to distinguish between multiple instances of the same application
        in a single container. If a container does not allow multiple instances
        of the same application to coexist, this parameter may be omitted. The

        identify an instance of an application in a container.</t>

        may include this parameter.</t>
        <t hangText="xoauth_public_key">Optional. An opaque identifier for the
        public key used to sign the request. This parameter may be omitted by
        containers that do not use public keys to sign requests, or if the
        container arranges other means of key distribution with the target of

      </list></section>
      <section title="Key management">
       <t>If a container uses public keys to sign requests, the container may
       choose to use either self-signed certificates or certificates signed by
       a well-known certificate authority. If a container does not distribute
       its OAuth signing key over HTTPS, it should use a certificate signed by
       a well-known certificate authority.</t>
       <t>The commonName attribute of the certificate should match the hostname
       of the container server, and should also match the value of the
       oauth_consumer_key parameter specified in the request.</t>
       <t>The container should make its public key available for download at a
       well-known location. The location
       https://[container-hostname]/opensocial/certificates/xoauth_public_keyvalue
       is recommended.</t>
       <t>Recipients of signed requests must verify that the signature on the
       request is correct, and that the timestamp on the request is within a
       reasonable time window. A time window of 5 minutes before and after the
       current time is recommended.</t>
       <t>Recipients of signed requests may use the oauth_consumer_key and
       xoauth_public_key parameters to automatically detect when a container
       deploys new certificates. If the container deploys certificates at a
       well-known location, the recipient may automatically download the new
       certificate. Recipients that automatically download new certificates
       should cache the resulting certificates.</t>
       <t>If a container's certificate is not downloaded from
       https://[container-hostname], the recipient should verify that the
       certificate is signed by a well-known certificate authority before
       trusting the certificate.</t>

      <section title="OAuth authorization">
       <t>If opt_params[gadgets.io.RequestParameters.AUTHORIZATION] is set to
       gadgets.io.AuthorizationType.OAUTH, the container needs to use OAuth to
       gain access to the resource specified in the request. This may require
       that the gadget obtain the user's content by directing the user to the
       service provider to gain access.</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Additional parameters">
       <t>The following additional parameters may be specified in opt_params: 
       <list style="hanging">
        <t hangText="gadgets.io.RequestParameters.OAUTH_SERVICE_NAME">The
        nickname the gadget uses to refer to the OAuth &lt;Service&gt; element
        from its XML spec. If unspecified, defaults to "".</t>
        <t hangText="gadgets.io.RequestParameters.OAUTH_TOKEN_NAME">The
        nickname the gadget uses to refer to an OAuth token granting access to
        a particular resources. If unspecified, defaults to "". Gadgets can use
        multiple token names if they have access to multiple resources from the
        same service provider. For example, a gadget with access to a contact
        list and a calendar might use a token name of "contacts" to use the
        contact list token, and a contact list of "calendar" to use the
        calendar token.</t>
        <t hangText="gadgets.io.RequestParameters.OAUTH_REQUEST_TOKEN">A
        service provider may be able to automatically provision a gadget with a
        request token that is preapproved for access to a resource. The gadget
        can use that token with the OAUTH_REQUEST_TOKEN parameter. This
        parameter is optional.</t>
        <t hangText="gadgets.io.RequestParameters.OAUTH_REQUEST_TOKEN_SECRET">
        The secret corresponding to a preapproved request token. This parameter
        is optional.</t>
       </list></t>
       <t>If OAuth is used, the container should execute the OAuth protocol on
       behalf of the gadget. If the gadget has not registered a consumer key
       for use with this service provider, the container may choose to use a
       default RSA signing key corresponding to a well-known certificate to
       sign requests. If the container uses a default consumer key, it will
       include an additional OAuth parameter xoauth_app_url that identifies the
       gadget making the request.</t>

      <section title="The callback parameter">
       <t>The function specified as the callback parameter is passed a JavaScript object with the following fields: 
       <list style="hanging">
         <t hangText="data">Parsed data of the response, if applicable. This will contain a different type of data depending on the type of request that was made. See the ContentType parameters for information about what to expect in this field. The raw response text is returned if the response could not be parsed.</t>
         <t hangText="errors">This will contain an array of any errors that occurred when making this request. For example, if a 500 error occurred in the request: [ "500 error" ]</t>
         <t hangText="headers">An object containing the response headers. Header names are used as the keys for this object.</t>
         <t hangText="rc">This is a numeric value representing the HTTP status code of the response.</t>
         <t hangText="text">This will return the unparsed text of the response.</t>
        <t hangText="oauthApprovalUrl">If this value is specified, the user
        needs to visit an external page to approve the gadget's request to
        access data. Use of a pop-up window to direct the user to the external
        page is recommended. Once the user has approved access, the gadget can
        repeat the makeRequest call to retrieve the data.</t>
        <t hangText="oauthError">If this value is specified, it indicates an
        OAuth-related error occurred. The value will be one of a set of string
        constants that can be used for programmatically detecting errors. The
        constants are undefined for opensocial-0.8, but implementers should
        attempt to agree on a set of useful constant values for standardization
        in opensocial-0.9.</t>
        <t hangText="oauthErrorText">If this value is specified, it indicates
        an OAuth-related error occurred. The value is free-form text that can
        be used to provide debugging information for gadget developers.</t>

      navigating from [Surface].valueX to [Surface].valueY, the container can
      stay on the same Surface but will show the appropriate &lt;Content&gt;
      sections whose View is [Surface].valueY. When navigating from
      SurfaceA.[Secondary] to SurfaceB.[Secondary], the container will switch
      to the SurfaceB surface and show the appropriate &lt;Content&gt; sections
      whose View is SurfaceB.[Secondary].In no cases must the .[Secondary] item

     <t>The osapi API is more natural to
     JavaScript developers and more succinct for creating OpenSocial gadgets
     than the existing JS APIs. It relies on the existing JSON-RPC protocol
     handlers, and is marked by the use of simple JSON objects as input and
     output. Note: this specification follows the JSON-RPC spec 1:1, but could
     also be implemented over REST.</t>
      <list style="symbols">
       <t>Introduces standard method signature for data requests - JSON in,
       JSON out</t>
       <t>Input and output parameters match JSON-RPC calls 1:1 and share
       documentation</t>
       <t>Data requests look like functions on "service" objects, e.g.,
       osapi.people.get(), instead of
       opensocial.DataRequest.newXXXRequest()</t>
       <t>Data requests can be called individually or as part of a batch</t>
       <t>Batch calls are designed for call chaining. The newBatch() call
       returns the batch, as does add, so that you can succinctly add more
       requests to the batch and execute it.</t>
       <t>Located in the osapi namespace</t>
      </list>
     <t>A container MUST emit the osapi JavaScript libraries and data files
     required by the libraries if an application includes &lt;Require
     feature="osapi"/&gt; in the ModulePrefs section of the gadget XML file.
     The container SHOULD emit the osapi JavaScript libraries and data files
     required by the libraries if an application optionally requests the
     feature by including &lt;Optional feature="osapi"/&gt; in the ModulePrefs
     of the gadget XML file.</t>
     <section title="Service Objects">
        <t>Services objects available are dependent upon the container. The server SHOULD generate service objects for all available services. For example, Social API Servers supporting services such as <eref target="Social-API-Server.xml#People-Service">People</eref>, and <eref target="Social-API-Server.xml#Activities-Service">Activities</eref> would create JavaScript objects for osapi.people and osapi.activites.</t>
        <t>Each service object SHOULD make JavaScript functions available for all methods that the service supports. These functions SHOULD take a single parameter which is a JavaScript representation of the service method's parameters.  These functions MUST return a <x:ref>osapi.Request</x:ref> object that may be sent immediately by the <x:ref>osapi.Request.execute</x:ref>, or may be added to a <x:ref>osapi.BatchRequest</x:ref>.</t>
        <t>Developers wanting to write gadgets safely can test for the existence of a service and method as follows:</t>

  <section title="Data Pipelining" anchor="DataPipelining">
   <t>Data Pipelining is a declarative syntax for defining the data a gadget requires from the container. The &lt;os:DataRequest&gt; element provides access to OpenSocial data, and the &lt;os:HttpRequest&gt; element provides access to content from any HTTP endpoint.</t>
   <t>All Data Pipelining tags MUST have a 'key' attribute which contains a string that is used to identify the data in the response.
   Values of the key attribute are case-sensitive when referenced through the data context object or the Expression Language.</t>
   <t>Tags that invoke API Server methods support a 1:1 mapping between the XML
   attributes and the service method parameters.  See <xref target="Core-API-Server"/> and <xref target="Social-API-Server"/> for information on the parameters available for each service method. Note that Data Pipelining MUST only be used for API Server calls that get data. Service methods that update data MUST NOT be implemented as Data Pipelining tags.</t>
   <t>Here's an example of Data Pipelining tags in a gadget XML file.</t>

   parameter.</t>

  <section title="Handling of errors">
   <t>With pipelined data prepared for proxied content, errors are simply
   delivered to the href of the &lt;Content&gt; element as POSTed JSON data
   with the JSON-RPC error format unmodified.</t>
   <t>With pipelined data prepared for the Javascript API, or otherwise
   embedded in @type="html" content, per-item errors are not modified, but
   errors that fail the entire request are modified by cloning the error into
   each item. 
   <figure>
   <preamble>Example</preamble>
   <artwork xml:space="preserve">
  &lt;script xmlns:os="http://ns.opensocial.org/2008/markup" type="text/os-data"&gt;
    &lt;os:ViewerRequest key="vwr"/&gt;
    &lt;os:PeopleRequest key="vf" userId="@viewer" groupId="@friends"/&gt;
  &lt;/script&gt;
</artwork>If the above request failed with a server error, the resulting
dataset would contain content resembling: 
   <artwork xml:space="preserve">
 {vwr: {error: {message: 'Server error', code: 500}}, vf: {error: {message: 'Server error', code: 500}}}  
</artwork></figure></t>
  </section>
  <section title="Handling of unrecognized tags">
   <t>Containers should ignore unrecognized tags or return error code 404 (Not
   Found). If a tag is ignored, the JSON structure can either include a null
   value for the request key or just not include the request key.</t>
  </section>
  <section title="Namespace">
   <t>The XML namespace for all of the Data Pipelining tags is
   http://ns.opensocial.org/2008/markup. (Note that namespace declarations on
   &lt;Content&gt; and &lt;Module&gt; elements do not apply to content inside
   of CDATA sections, so namespaces must be declared within CDATA.)</t>
  </section>
  <section title="Dynamic parameters">
   <t>Data and HTTP requests often need to change based on input parameters.
   Two key use cases:
   <list style="symbols">
    <t>Passing gadgets view parameters to a request, for example the current
    page in a paginated list.</t>
    <t>Passing OpenSocial data to a following &lt;os:HttpRequest&gt;,
    specifically IDs of (viewer, owner, viewer friends, owner friends).</t>
   </list></t>
   <t>Data pipelining will support a limited subset of the expression language
   used in OpenSocial templates (based on
   <xref target="JSPEL">JSP EL</xref>):
   <list style="symbols">
    <t>Expressions of format ${A(.B)*} will be supported, where "A" is the key
    and "B" is any number of properties. Examples: ${UserPrefs.size},
    ${ViewParams.nav.first}.</t>
    <t>Multiple expressions may appear within a single attribute, and mixed
    with non-expression text. The result of all non-expression text and
    expression evaluations will be concatenated.</t>
    <t>The key "ViewParams" is reserved and refers to the parameters passed
    into the gadget rendering, equivalent to
    <xref target="gadgets.views.getParams">gadgets.views.getParams()</xref>.</t>
    <t>The key "UserPrefs" is reserved and refers to gadget user preferences -
    ${UserPrefs.PREF} will return the value of gadgets.Prefs.getString('PREF')
    - see [API].</t>
   </list>The results of expression evaluation are treated as if the results
   were inserted as the literal string value of the XML attribute. JSON arrays
   within ViewParams are output as "a,b", not "[a,b]". The results of
   expression evaluation for URL-typed attributes - specifically, @href and
   @param on &lt;os:HttpRequest&gt; - MUST be
   <eref target="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1738.txt">RFC 1738, Section 2.2
   encoded (URL encoded)</eref> before being inserted into a final string.</t>
   <t>The following attributes support expressions:
   <list style="symbols">
    <t>Any attribute on os:DataRequest other than @key and @method</t>
    <t>@userId</t>
    <t>@groupId</t>
    <t>@fields</t>
    <t>@startIndex</t>
    <t>@count</t>
    <t>@sortBy</t>
    <t>@sortOrder</t>
    <t>@filterBy</t>
    <t>@filterOp</t>
    <t>@filterValue</t>
    <t>@activityIds</t>
    <t>@href</t>
    <t>@params</t>
   </list>An implementation MUST evaluate dynamic properties for these
   attributes and MUST NOT evaluate dynamic properties for attributes not on
   this list.</t>
   <t>
    <figure>
     <preamble>Example</preamble>
     <artwork xml:space="preserve">
&lt;os:PeopleRequest key="PagedFriends" userId="@owner" groupId="@friends" startIndex="${ViewParams.first}" count="20"/&gt;
&lt;os:HttpRequest href="http://example.com/api?ids=${PagedFriends.ids}"/&gt;
</artwork>
    </figure>
   </t>
   <t>
   Dynamic parameters may access request attributes of other data tags through the special "Request" key
   and response meta information of other data requests through the reserved keys "totalResults", "startIndex", and "count".
    <figure>
     <preamble>Example</preamble>
     <artwork xml:space="preserve">
&lt;os:PeopleRequest key="Page1" userId="@owner" groupId="@friends"
  startIndex="${ViewParams.first}" count="20"/&gt;

&lt;os:PeopleRequest key="Page2" userId="${Page1.Request.userId}" groupId="@friends"
  startIndex="${Page1.Request.startIndex + Page1.Request.count}"
  count="${Page1.Request.count}"/&gt;

    <!-- ============================== class summary ========================== -->
    <t>OAuth popup window manager.</t>
    <t>Expected usage:
    <list style="numbers">
     <t>Gadget attempts to fetch OAuth data for the user and discovers that
     approval is needed. The gadget creates two new UI elements:
     <list style="symbols">
      <t>a "personalize this gadget" button or link</t>
      <t>a "personalization done" button or link, which is initially
      hidden.</t>
     </list>The "personalization done" button may be unnecessary. The popup
     window manager will attempt to detect when the window closes. However, the
     "personalization done" button should still be displayed to handle cases
     where the popup manager is unable to detect that a window has closed. This
     allows the user to signal approval manually.</t>
     <t>Gadget creates a popup object and associates event handlers with the UI
     elements:
     <figure>
      <artwork xml:space="preserve">
// Called when the user opens the popup window.
var onOpen = function() {
  $("personalizeDone").style.display = "block"
}
// Called when the user closes the popup window.
var onClose = function() {
  $("personalizeDone").style.display = "none"
  fetchData();
}
var popup = new gadgets.oauth.Popup(
    response.oauthApprovalUrl,
    "height=300,width=200",
    onOpen,
    onClose
);
personalizeButton.onclick = popup.createOpenerOnClick();
personalizeDoneButton.onclick = popup.createApprovedOnClick();
</artwork>
     </figure></t>
     <t>When the user clicks the personalization button/link, a window is
     opened to the approval URL. The onOpen function is called to notify the
     gadget that the window was opened.</t>
     <t>When the window is closed, the popup manager calls the onClose function
     and the gadget attempts to fetch the user's data.</t>

    <section title="Formatting/Parsing using Predefined Patterns is Done within Default Locale">
     <t>Gadgets locale is set at render time. The i18n package above will use
     getCountry and getLanguage to load the corresponding formatter/parser for
     that locale if any of the functions in the package are invoked. For
     example, let's say gadgets has lanuguage as french and country as france,
     the i18n package will use formatter/parser following french conventions by
     default. That means gadget developers could format/parse French
     date/time/number/currency using the predefined CURRENCY_PATTERN.
     <figure>
      <preamble>Example</preamble>
      <artwork xml:space="preserve">
gadgets.i18n.parseNumber(gadgets.i18n.CURRENCY_PATTERN, "20 000 \u20AC"); // will return 20000
</artwork>
     </figure>They could also parse foreign currency by passing in a
     opt_currencyCode. Note when French writes an amount of foreign currency,
     they will still use the French way of writing numbers the positioning
     currency code - just the currency code is different.
     <figure>
      <preamble>Example</preamble>
      <artwork xml:space="preserve">
gadgets.i18n.parseNumber(gadgets.i18n.CURRENCY_PATTERN, "20 000 $", 0, "USD"); // will return 20000
</artwork>
     </figure>It gets a little bit complicated if a foreign currency written in
     the foreign way is to be parsed. In that case, predefined patterns won't
     work, and string patterns need to be used. The example below returns 0
     (indicating error in parsing), as the number presented is not in French
     format.
     <figure>
      <preamble>Example</preamble>
      <artwork xml:space="preserve">
gadgets.i18n.parseNumber(gadgets.i18n.CURRENCY_PATTERN, "$20,000"); // will return 0, indicating error
</artwork>
     </figure>To make this work, a string pattern needs to be passed in, like
     what is done below:
     <figure>
      <preamble>Example</preamble>
      <artwork xml:space="preserve">
gadgets.i18n.parseNumber("#,###", "$20,000", 0, "USD"); // will return 20000

      <t>Both Formatting and Parsing following the same pattern specification.
      The date/time pattern specifications are found in
      <eref target="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/#Date_Format_Patterns">
      Unicode Locale Data Markup Language, Date Format Patterns</eref> The
      following specifiers are not required in this release:
      <list style="symbols">

       <t>W: Week of Month.</t>
       <t>D: Day of year.</t>
       <t>F: Day of Week in Month.</t>
       <t>g: Modified Julian day</t>
      </list></t>
     </section>
     <section title="Number Pattern Specification">
      <t>Many characters in a pattern are taken literally; they are matched
      during parsing and output unchanged during formatting. Special
      characters, on the other hand, stand for other characters, strings, or
      classes of characters. For example, the '#' character is replaced by a
      localized digit. Often the replacement character is the same as the
      pattern character; in the U.S. locale, the ',' grouping character is
      replaced by ','. However, the replacement is still happening, and if the
      symbols are modified, the grouping character changes. Some special
      characters affect the behavior of the formatter by their presence; for
      example, if the percent character is seen, then the value is multiplied
      by 100 before being displayed.</t>
      <t>To insert a special character in a pattern as a literal, that is,
      without any special meaning, the character must be quoted. There are some
      exceptions to this which are noted below.</t>
      <t>The characters listed here are used in non-localized patterns.
      Localized patterns use the corresponding characters taken from
      corresponding locale symbol collection. Two exceptions are the currency
      sign and quote, which are not localized.

       <c>Currency sign, replaced by currency symbol. If doubled, replaced by

       <c>Prefix or suffix</c>
       <c>No</c>
       <c>Used to quote special characters in a prefix or suffix, for example,
       "'#'#" formats 123 to "#123". To create a single quote itself, use two
       in a row: "# o''clock".</c>
      </texttable>A NumberFormat pattern contains a postive and negative
      subpattern, for example, "#,##0.00;(#,##0.00)". Each subpattern has a
      prefix, a numeric part, and a suffix. If there is no explicit negative
      subpattern, the negative subpattern is the localized minus sign prefixed
      to the positive subpattern. That is, "0.00" alone is equivalent to
      "0.00;-0.00". If there is an explicit negative subpattern, it serves only
      to specify the negative prefix and suffix; the number of digits, minimal
      digits, and other characteristics are ignored in the negative subpattern.
      That means that "#,##0.0#;(#)" has precisely the same result as
      "#,##0.0#;(#,##0.0#)".</t>
      <t>The prefixes, suffixes, and various symbols used for infinity, digits,
      thousands separators, decimal separators, etc. may be set to arbitrary
      values, and they will appear properly during formatting. However, care
      must be taken that the symbols and strings do not conflict, or parsing
      will be unreliable. For example, the decimal separator and thousands
      separator should be distinct characters, or parsing will be
      impossible.</t>
      <t>The grouping separator is a character that separates clusters of
      integer digits to make large numbers more legible. It commonly used for
      thousands, but in some locales it separates ten-thousands. The grouping
      size is the number of digits between the grouping separators, such as 3
      for "100,000,000" or 4 for "1 0000 0000".</t>

      <t>&lt;static&gt; Type: {string} gadgets.i18n.formatDateTime(pattern,
      date)</t>
      <t>Description: This method formats a "Date" object with provided pattern
      specification. The pattern could be a string using ICU notation or a
      predefined pattern. A string using ICU notation offers the most
      flexibility. Each field as specified in the pattern has locale specific
      behavior. The pattern string is allowed to contain string literals, and
      one type of pattern might not work for all locales. In those case, the
      pattern itself could also be locale specific, thus not good for sharing
      among locales.

      <t>&lt;static&gt; Type: {number} gadgets.i18n.parseDateTime(pattern,
      text, start, date)</t>
      <t>Description: This method will parse the input string ("text"),
      interpretting it as specified by pattern. The parsed result will be saved
      into a Date object ("date"). "start" indicates from where in the string
      the parse should start. This method returns the number of characters
      consumed.

      </figure>A whole piece of string is usually the target for parsing. But
      in some cases, you might just want to parse part of the string, "start"
      parameter and return value also make it very convenient. For example,
      suppose you want to parse a string like "88/01, 99/03, 98/05, 97/02", the
      following code will do the job. 
      <figure>
       <preamble>Example</preamble>
       <artwork xml:space="preserve">
var date_array = [];
var pos = 0;
var text = "88/01, 99/03, 98/05, 97/02";
while(1) {
 var date = new Date;
    var consumed = gadgets.i18n.parseDateTime("yy/MM", text, pos, date);
    if (consumed &lt;= 0) break;
    date_array.push(date);
    pos += consumed;
    if (pos &lt; text.length &amp;&amp; text[pos] == ',') ++pos;
    if (pos &lt; text.length &amp;&amp; text[pos] == ' ') ++pos;
}
</artwork>
      </figure>Similar to the formatting functions, a predefined pattern could
      also be passed in as the first parameter.
